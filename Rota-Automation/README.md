# Rota Automation with Python, Power BI, and Power Platform

> **Project Type:** Scheduling Automation and Dashboarding  
> **Tools Used:** Python, Excel, Power BI, Power Automate, Power Apps

---

## Overview

This project automates staff rota generation using Python and integrates it with the Microsoft Power Platform for seamless distribution and reporting. The solution replaces a manual process that previously required significant manager time and effort, saving approximately **0.7 FTE**. It supports fair shift distribution, weekend coverage, and flexible holiday input.

The rota is created based on key constraints and delivered as an Excel file. Itâ€™s then visualised in **Power BI** and surfaced via **Power Apps** to make it easily accessible to staff and managers.

---

## Workflow

1. **Trigger**: Rota generation starts via Power Automate (either manually or through uploaded holiday data).
2. **Azure Function Call**: Sends holiday and staff inputs to a hosted Python rota generator.
3. **Rota Creation**: Python logic calculates shift assignments while balancing fairness, rest days, and skill needs.
4. **Export**: The result is sent back as JSON and converted to Excel by Power Automate.
5. **Visualisation**: Power BI pulls from Excel to build rota dashboards.
6. **Access**: Dashboards are embedded in Power Apps for easy team-wide access.

## Key Features

- **Automated rota generation** â€“ handles custom business constraints (fairness, weekends, rest days).
- **Power BI dashboard** â€“ visualises shifts per person and per day, making planning transparent.
- **Power Platform integration** â€“ built for real-time updates via Power Automate and Power Apps.
- **Reusable and scalable** â€“ can adapt to other departments or rota rules.
